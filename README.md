# University_Notes
This repository contains my notes written in Latex for some of the courses I attended at the University of Pisa.

## Table of content
- `Parallel_and_distributed_systems_paradigms_and_models` is written in English. Notes from the homonym course at the University of Pisa.
- `Human_language_technologies` is written in English. Notes from the homonym course at the University of Pisa.
- `Charts` and `Bachelor's thesis` are written in Italian. `Charts` contains a framework I developed to let people correctly choose a chart in an IoT dashboard. `Bachelor's thesis` describes what I have done for my Bachelor's thesis. Summing up, I "coordinate" a group of other three colleagues to create an IoT framework for vocal and graphical interfaces. I also develop the backend of the system.
